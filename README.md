# IET Connect
## Introduction
This website is for the students of IET Agra, affiliated to Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University.
Upon completion, this project may have following features:
* Students will be able to download previous year examination papers for their exam prep.
* They will be able to connect to the whole community just by logging in with their college number e.g. 20CSE01, 21ECE01, 22ME01 etc.
* If we are able to do so, students will also be able to see their attendance insights.
* Sharing college photos and making IET a better place by the students will also be possible.
